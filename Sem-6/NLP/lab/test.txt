Okay, so, like, basically, I was thinking, you know, maybe, just maybe, we could, possibly, try to, you know, implement, like, a new feature, or something, I don't know, maybe, version 3.14, or 2.71, I'm not really sure, but, hey, it's worth a shot, right? So, yeah, let's, um, get started, I guess, and, oh, by the way, did I mention, we'll need, like, 1000 cups of coffee, or more, to, you know, fuel our brains, and stuff.
