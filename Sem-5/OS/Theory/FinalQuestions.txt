**QUESTION 1 (CLO-2, C2, PLO-2) [10 Marks]**  

Compare the following set of processes, with the length of the CPU burst time given in milliseconds:

| Process | Burst Time | Priority |
|---------|------------|----------|
| P1      | 2          | 2        |
| P2      | 1          | 1        |
| P3      | 8          | 4        |
| P4      | 4          | 2        |
| P5      | 5          | 3        |

The processes are assumed to have arrived in the order P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, all at time 0.  

Classify four Gantt charts that illustrate the execution of these processes using the following scheduling algorithms:  
- FCFS  
- SJF  
- Non-preemptive priority (a larger priority number implies a higher priority)  
- RR (Quantum = 2)

Show turnaround time, waiting time, and average waiting time also.

**QUESTION 2 (CLO-2, C3, PLO-3) [10 Marks]**

Demonstrate a scenario where two concurrent processes, P0 and P1, need to access a critical section of code. Implement Peterson's solution in pseudocode to ensure mutual exclusion and answer the following questions:  

a) Outline the pseudocode implementation of Peterson's solution for mutual exclusion.  
b) Illustrate how the solution ensures that only one process can enter the critical section at a time.  
c) Summarize any potential limitations or drawbacks of Peterson's solution.

**QUESTION 3 [CLO-3, C2, PLO-2] [10 Marks]**

Construct the following snapshot of a system:

|   | Allocation | Max Need |
|---|------------|----------|
| T0| 1 2 0 2    | 4 3 1 6  |
| T1| 0 1 1 2    | 2 4 2 4  |
| T2| 1 2 4 0    | 3 6 5 1  |
| T3| 1 2 0 1    | 2 6 2 3  |
| T4| 1 0 0 1    | 3 1 1 2  |

Using the Banker's algorithm, identify whether or not each of the following states is unsafe. If the state is safe, select the order in which the threads may complete; otherwise, identify why the state is unsafe.

a. Available = (2, 2, 2, 3)  
b. Available = (4, 4, 1, 1)  
c. Available = (3, 0, 1, 4)  
d. Available = (1, 5, 2, 2)

**QUESTION 4 [CLO-3, C3, PLO-2] [20 Marks]**

a) Make use of a logical address space of 256 pages with a 4-KB page size, mapped onto a memory of 64 frames. How many bits are required in the logical and physical address?

b) Identify the cause of thrashing? How does the system plan to detect and eliminate thrashing?

b. Acyclic-Graph Directories  
c. General Graph Directories
